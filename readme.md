## Files
The PCB and schematics are made for KiCAD. In KiCAD you can generate the Gerber files and send them to your PCB manufacturer.

## Components
* 1x PCB
* 1x 0.1mm thick plastic board
* 1x double-sided tape
(Since it is difficult to insert the connector as is, it is necessary to attach a thin plastic plate to the connector contact area.)
